    "The three-way ANOVA is an extension of the two-way ANOVA for assessing whether there is an interaction effect between three independent categorical variables on a continuous outcome variable.\n",

    "We’ll use the **headache dataset** [datarium package], which contains the measures of migraine headache episode pain score in 72 participants treated with three different treatments. The participants include 36 males and 36 females. Males and females were further subdivided into whether they were at low or high risk of migraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand how each independent variable (type of treatments, risk of migraine and gender) interact to predict the pain score."
